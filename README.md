Backstory:

Your dad left you at birth and you moms the only family you have left… However, your mom is in the hospital with an incurable disease, you've been mourning this for years, and it's almost her time to pass… You are weeping at the side of your bed not knowing what to do. As you plead to God for help, eyes blurry, and tears dripping down the side of your face, you see a glimmering light appear in front of you. You look up to see a shining portal in front of you. You almost pass out from shock but you hear a voice…

“What is it that you desire?”

Wiping the tears off your face, “All I want is for my mother to live”

“Come through the portal, conquer this realm, and you shall have what you seek.”

You walk towards the portal scarcely, passing through. OR You don't walk through the portal and your mom dies and you kys

As you pass through the bright light, you find yourself on the back of a wagon being pulled by a horse ridden by an old merchant.

“Ah, it seems you’ve finally come to your senses”, as he whips his horse to go faster, “I found you unconscious near the ruins, why would a B class sorcerer like you be all the way out there?”

I don’t know what you’re talking about? WAIT, what is that green monster chasing us. Merchant says, IT’S A GOBLIN

A Goblin? 

How does a B class Sorcerer not know about the most common monster! He must have amnesia. Just use your sword and attack it. Quickly it's catching up.
‘The Goblin jumps on the back of the wagon’ Use your sword and attack it already.

Question:
Attack the Heart
Attack the Brain

If attacks the Heart than merchant says you dumbass Goblins have 3 hearts


One Goblin is killed, 

What the heck, H-how did I do that, am I that powerful

Mechant: You really must have forgotten, Here take this healing potion!

Option:
Drink potion 


Sorcerer: This potion is incredible, Do you happen to know where I can find the strongest potion here. 

Merchant: It is at the Ruins where I found you, If you kill the Demon Boss He will drop the sacred potion of healing.

Sorcerer: Understood, Thank you for all you have done but i’m afraid I must go defeat him (Jumps out of wagon)

Merchant: Wait, you can’t beat him unless you are a A class sorcerer, so I guess if you have really set your eyes on it then I can give you something that will help you get A as fast as possible. Just take this teleporter, just simply say Teleport to and then say the place you want to teleport to, and you will appear right outside of where you are trying to go. 

Sorcerer: Thank you, but why 

Mechant: Because he murdered my son who was a S class Sorcerer

Sorcerer: Gulp


Merchant: Anyway,  if you are trying to get stronger than to beat the eldest son of the Goblins royal family in the ancient Forest!

Sorcerer: I’ll do that, Teleport to ancient Forest!

Walks inside the forest for hours and at last he finds a decayed temple, he walks towards the temple to open the door 

Type: open to open the door

As he enters the temple he sets his eyes on the Goblin boss

Goblin Boss: Ahhh-aaaaa-rrrrrr

Sorcerer: I have come to kill you

Use your sword to attempt a slash 

This attack had no affect

Goblin throws a rock at you:
Type Dodge to Dodge

You were too slow and the rock hit you in the head caused you to feel extremely dizzy

This head injury caused you to remember something you never experienced before, which is the skill Infuse. This skill allows you to infuse your sword with fire magic.

To use new skill type Infuse:

You sprinted at the goblin with your infused sword.

Where would you like to attack:

Attack Heart
Attack Brain
Cut one arm off

If attacks Heart than the goblin punches you into a wall and you die

If attacks Brain than you deal an immense amount of damage causing him to be immobilized
 
If you cut off an arm than he kicks you into a wall and kills you


When you attack the brain you caused the Goblin to fall on his back and so you use Infuse one more time 

Type Infuse to Stab him in the Brain to finish him off

You successfully slayed the Goblin and he dropped a teleporter to the Ancient ruins

Without any hesitation he uses the special item to teleport right outside of the Ancient Ruins 

He lays his eyes on 2 guards holding bows that are guarding the front gate, he tries to run behind a huge rock for cover but before he can get there, he gets shot in the shoulder. 

He goes to peek over the rock to see their position, however a random archer comes out of nowhere, pushes you down and then says stay here. 

The Archer shot both of the guards and killed them. 

Thank you, but who are you?

My name is Archer

Archer: Would you like to make an alliance for now

Type A to alliance with archer

I Think that’s a good idea but why are you here.

Archer: I am here to kill the demon boss

Sorcerer: That is my goal too, so let's stick together for now

You then walk through the entrance gate and see a bunch of ruins as well as a huge Castle in the middle of the Ancient Ruins 
Archer: Where do you think we should start?

Sorcerer: I think going to that castle is a pretty safe bet

As you walk towards the tower a huge wave of demons suddenly appears!

Archer shoots them but, there are to many for him to handle 

The huge army is rushing at you

Type, Infuse to infuse your sword with your fire magic 

3 demons are about to stab you 

Type triple kill to kill all 3 of them with Infuse

Good job, However there are way to much for only the 2 of you 

You are getting run over by them, but thanks to the last 3 demons you killed you now are an A class Sorcerer and you can now use the magic skill fireball,

You create a flame in your sword, which generates a fireball you can throw at anyone!
You can also use mega fireball, However, after using it you can not use any magic for 2 minutes

What attack

Use Mega fireball to take them out
Use Fireball so you don’t have a magic cooldown


If they use Mega fireball then they will wipe out all the demons that are sounding them but not in time for Archer to not be killed brutally with 4 stab wounds. 

If use fireball then it takes out the Demons around them, However afterwards he gets overwhelmed and dies.

After he successfully uses the mega fireball to kill the hoard of demons you walk over to the Archer to exam his wounds and come to the conclusion that he is dead

You take his bow and arrows off of his corpse and you can now use infuse on the arrows after the 2 minute cooldown of your mana is done.

Once you take his bow you walk towards the castle where you are assuming the Demon Boss is.

Once you get to the Castle doors a Crimson Dragon appears, Before you enter the castle you must defeat the Crimson dragon .



The Dragon flies 1000m into the sky and then shoots a fireball at you:
Type Sprint to run away from the dragons fireball
Type dodge to dodge the fireball it is closing in

You successfully dodged the fireball, However the explosion caused you to go flying into one of the ruin walls

“Ouch, That really hurt”
You tank that hit and stand up and resume trying to defeat him.

Your 2 minute timer is up and you can now use magic again!

Type Infuse arrow to infuse your fire magic in your arrow

Good Job, Now that You have done that type Fire to fire

You shot at his stomach, However it had no effect. 

The Crimson dragon starts screaming with confidence
You panic and shoot arrow after arrow with no infused magic in your arrow just hoping for something!!

Suddenly you hear the dragon scream in agony

You are very confused since the arrow wasn’t infused, However after closer inspection you see a spot where the dragon is already injured and that spot is on his head.

Unfortunately, after you hit the dragon in its weak spot it puts his guard back up and comes flying at you in the intent to impale you with his claws. 
Hurry up, quickly Type Dodge to dodge

You successfully dodged that fatal attack.

You now use all of the magic you have left and Infuse the one of your arrows with fire magic

With your arching skills you only have a 3% chance of hitting your mark!

The dragon is flying towards you at mach 5 and if you don’t hit this shot and the dodge then you are dead

After you fire you only have 1.3 seconds to dodge, if you fail then you die

Now Type fire to fire 

Hurry up type dodge you are already taking to long

Good job, You successfully hit the dragon's weak spot which caused him to go crashing onto the ground.

But he is still slightly twitching, grab your sword to stab the spot your arrow hit the dragon to finish him off. 

You cannot use infuse, because that took all of the magic you had left, but your normal sword should be more than sufficient. 

Type Grab to Grab your sword

Type stab to stab the Dragon through his injury and thus stabbing his brain.

Congratulations! You have defeated the Crimson Dragon and you are now an A Rank Sorcerer 

The Crimson Dragon drops a healing potions as well as the key to enter the castle

Press Enter to enter the castle 

You entered the castle and right when you entered you see a extremely long hallway.

You follow this hallway and when you finally reach the end of it there is nothing but a frozen door.

You decide not to enter until the morning, because all of your mana has been depleted from your last battle, but it should all be restored by the morning. 

13 hours later

It is now the morning and since you have all of your magic back you decide to open the frozen door, 

Type open to open the door

You have entered the room and when you look at your surroundings you see a frozen room with the floor ceiling, walls and roof all covered with ice, but with no enemy to be seen. 

You keep slipping on the ground and so use fireball to remove all the ice off the ground

Type fireball to unfreeze the ground

Right when you unfreeze the ground the Frost Queen Demon Appears

You have an advantage in this fight since your special powers are fire based. However This Frost queen has defeated S rank sorcerers before
